Zenonia is an action role-playing game created, developed, and published by Gamevil for various platforms, including iOS, Android, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DSi, Zeebo and Windows Mobile. It was released on the App Store on May 24, 2009 and on the Google Play Store on March 27, 2010. It was released for the PlayStation Portable on October 12, 2010. The main character, Regret, is controlled through use of an on-screen d-pad, which is located in the lower left corner of the screen. There are many side quests that the player can choose to complete in order to further explore the world. The main storyline can be changed by the player depending on whether they decide to make certain choices that will cause their character's alignment to shift more quickly towards good or evil. There are four classes in which the player can choose from: Paladin, Warrior, Druid, or Assassin, each having a unique fighting style. The game also features hundreds of different weapons, and a full class skill tree for each of the classes. Gamevil claims that Zenonia has 40 hours of gameplay. Regret's in-game appearance changes based upon his equipped weapon and armor set.

If you are a fan of classic action RPGs like Zelda or Secret of Mana, you might want to try Zenonia on your Nintendo DS. Zenonia is one of the few games that was released for the Nintendo DSiWare service, which allows you to download games directly to your DSi system. You can find Zenonia on the Nintendo eShop for $7.99. However, if you don't have a DSi or you want to play Zenonia on your PC or smartphone, you can also download a rom file of Zenonia and use an emulator to run it.
 
A rom file is a digital copy of a game cartridge that can be played on a computer or a mobile device using a software that mimics the original console's hardware. An emulator is a program that allows you to run rom files on your device. There are many emulators available for different platforms and consoles. For example, you can use DeSmuME to play Nintendo DS games on your PC, or DraStic to play them on your Android phone.
